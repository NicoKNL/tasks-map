**Tasks Map** is a minimal Obsidian plugin that visualizes your `- [ ] tasks` as an interactive graph. Each task is represented as a node, with edges showing relationships based on special emoji/link syntax in your task text as implemented in the popular Tasks plugin.

## Pre-requisites

-   **Required:** You must have both the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin and the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin installed and enabled in your vault.

## Features

-   **Graph Visualization:** See all your Dataview tasks as draggable nodes in a React Flow graph.
-   **Custom Nodes:** Each node displays task summary, tags, priority emoji, and completion status (color-coded).
-   **Task Relationships:** Edges are created based on special emoji/link syntax (üÜî for outgoing, ‚õî for incoming, with hashes).
-   **Edge Management:** Select and delete edges (removes the hash from both tasks/files).
-   **Tag Filtering:** Filter visible tasks by tag using a multi-select dropdown overlay.
-   **Quick Navigation:** Open the linked file for any task directly from the node.
-   **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed/incomplete directly from the graph.
-   **UI Overlays:** Modern overlays for tag filtering and reloading tasks.
-   **Priority & Emoji Support:** Priority emoji (üî∫, ‚è´, üîº, üîΩ, ‚è¨) and robust emoji rendering.
-   **Automatic Layout:** Uses dagre for clean, readable graph layouts.
